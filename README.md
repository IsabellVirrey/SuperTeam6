# Superteam6 

## Description

Our website allows users to locate chargers within a 5, 10 , or 20 mile radius of your location. Our website will also provide you with the weather conditions at those locations, so you'll always know what to expect! Especailly if you just had your car cleaned.

- Our motivation for building this website is to improve the user  experience from normal EV finders, in that we removed the excess clutter that other EV finders add. So just the important stuff!

- A few of us have EVs so this project is not only useful but personal to some of us.

- It helps EV drivers find the closest EV charger to them especially when you don't have that much range.

- Our webiste gives you all the need to knows, like: 
- how fast the charger is 
- Who is the provider of the charger 
- The type of charger
- And most importantly where those chargers are
