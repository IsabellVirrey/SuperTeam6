# Superteam6 

## Description

Our website allows users to locate chargers within a 5, 10 , or 20 mile radius of your location. Our website will also provide you with the weather conditions at those locations, so you'll always know what to expect! Especailly if you just had your car cleaned.

- Our motivation for building this website is to improve the user  experience from normal EV finders, in that we removed the excess clutter that other EV finders add. 

- A few of us have EVs so this project is not only useful but personal to some of us.

- It helps EV drivers find the closest EV charger to them especially when you don't have that much range.

- We learned that (still unsure as to what I'm adding here)

## Installation

- The Superteam6 Project is simple, and anyone with an internet connection will have access to the our projects functinality. SmartPhones, tablets, computers are all welcome.

# Usage 

- When users first land on our site, they are presented with an easy to read/understand user interface.

- Users will have the option of typing in a particular area or using the "use current location" button.

- The user will then have the option to select a distance ranging between 5, 10, or 20 mile radius.

- Our website will then present the user with the aviable options

- Additionally the SuperTeam6 Project goes above and beyond by providing users with the weather conditions at those locations!
